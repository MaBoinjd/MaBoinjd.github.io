## Week 8 Review Ticket

Focus this week was on making Create Task projects in preparation for AP Exam and catching crossover members up to speed on features that were missing from their project. Some concepts include:
- Creating [forked repositories](https://github.com/Pqhantom/csp-anthonys-harem) on GitHub
- Use of [blueprints](https://github.com/Pqhantom/csp-anthonys-harem/tree/main/create_task) to organize pages
