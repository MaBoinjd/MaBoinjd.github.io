## Policy

Every Friday, we will be stopping development on our website and deploying it for the week.

### In Class Friday

This time will be used for coding and preparing for deployment. We will finish up our tasks for the week.

### 9:00 PM Friday

At 9, all members must commit and push their changes. This ensures that everyone's ready and done by a reasonable time for our deployment manager to redeploy.

### 11:00 PM Friday

By 11, our deployment manager will have finished deploying the website and getting it running.

### 11:30 PM Friday

At 11:30, the deployment manager will communicate with the scrum master and tell him that the deployment is done. Then, the scrum master will do any last minute changes on the README and send Mr. Mortensen a message in Slack.
