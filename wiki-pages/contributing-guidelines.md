# Contributing Guidelines
### 1. If you didn't change it don't commit it
- Someone may not be done editing or working on the code and you don't know what the code does, so committing it may lead to more issues.
### 2. When merging make sure to check in with others in order to merge the right pieces of code
- Merging blindly without looking at what you are merging can lead to code overlap or old, non-working code entering back into the main system.
- Make sure you know what you are pushing.
### 3. Bug Fixes
- Try to work on and commit bug fixes asap
- Bug Fixes should be the first thing worked on no matter what.
### 4. Branching
- If you want to branch 
- If you branch and want to combine back with the main repository, ask for a pull request so we can confirm your changes and make sure everything is functioning. 
### 5. Ignored Files
- Certain files will be ignored when you commit by our .gitignore.
- **DO NOT** change the gitignore file and if you want it changed ask the GitHub Admin (Isaac Le) to get approval.

### 6. General Rule
- If you think what you are going to do is against the rules just ask the GitHub Admin (Isaac Le) to clarify on whether it is allowed or not.
- Use common sense and don't do anything dumb.
