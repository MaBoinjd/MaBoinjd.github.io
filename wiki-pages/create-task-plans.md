## Deadlines

### December 10
Come up with idea for create task, post it here

- Ethan: I will probably use scratch because I have a lot of experience with it. I think I will make a kind of game that involves all the different topics necessary for the create task, maybe a pong game or a galaga type game. 
- Isaac: I will create a game of connect four that will give you the win once you have 4 pieces connected together in a straight line. This being vertical, horizontal, or diagonal. The program will examine the board each round to determine if someone has won or not alternating the turns between the 2 players.
- Erik: I will create a game of Rock Paper Scissors that will allow each player to choose between the 3 options before the round. The program will determine a win, tie, or loss for each plyer
- Anthony: I will create a calculator that will calculate your test scores and give the average. For selection, it will find the lowest test score and drop it. The program will iterate through a list of given scores in order to average it out.
- Samuel: I will create a music maker that will allow you to create your own little beat, with different instruments and tones. This program will choose selective tones at certain time frames to form the beat that you create.

### December 17
Create pseudocode for create task: outlining functions, logic, and algorithm without actually coding 
- Example: Tic Tac Toe game pseudocode would include making the board, figuring out a winner, getting input and figuring out where the user wants to place their O/X, etc.

### January 7
Have first draft of create task code completed, share with group and review
