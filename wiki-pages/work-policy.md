# Work Policy

## Mondays
Every Monday, our team will plan for the week. During this process, we will add new issues to our scrum board as well as remove old ones from the previous week.

## Tuesday to Friday
During this period of time, our team will expand and work on our visions for the week. We'll also take notes on any TPT topics that are given to us.

## Friday Night/Afternoon
Our team will review each other's work and give Mr. Mortensen a deliverable in order to receive a grade for the week. This time is dedicated for last touches and polishing.

## Weekends
On the weekends, we will work on individual labs that aren't required or dive deep into any interests we have. If any of us are Operation Officers, this time will be for getting ahead on labs.
